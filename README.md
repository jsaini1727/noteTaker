This application called the Note Taker helps a user to write and saves notes thereby enabling them to organize themselves and not miss out something important during the course of the day, month or a year. When they click on the link to the notes page they are presented with a list of existing notes on the left and on the right they are provided with an empty field to enter the title of the note alongwith the text that will go with that respective note. The "Clear Form" appears when one enters the title and it is only when one starts writing in the text field that the "Save Note" shows up in the navigation bar. 
When the user chooses the save button that note is saved and it appears on the left side of the browser with the existing notes and the buttons disappear in the navigation.

navigation. When the user click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page then they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text
